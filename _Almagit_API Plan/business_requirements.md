# API Client Project Documentation

## Project Objective
Design an API Client to securely retrieve test cases and their steps from GitLab, process them, and insert the new test cases into Microfocus ALM.

## Project Requirements

### 1. Secure Authentication
  1.1. **GitLab and ALM Authentication**: Implement headless authentication mechanisms for both GitLab and ALM to ensure secure and automated access to these services.
  
  1.2. **Configuration Management**: Use a YAML configuration file for storing user-specific settings, including API credentials, to facilitate a personalized and secure interaction with the system.

### 2. Retrieval of Test Data from GitLab
  2.1. **Fetching Finalized Test Cases**: Develop functionality to pull the latest set of finalized Cypress test files from GitLab repositories.
  
  2.2. **Data Verification**: Implement a verification mechanism to ensure the integrity and completeness of the test data retrieved from GitLab.

### 3. Processing Test Cases for ALM
  3.1. **Test Case Formatting**: Establish a method to process and format the test cases from GitLab into a structure compatible with the ALM POST command.
  
  3.2. **Command Design**: Finalize and confirm the specifics of the POST command to efficiently upload the formatted test cases to Microfocus ALM.

### 4. Reporting Mechanism
  4.1. **Report Generation**: Create a feature to generate a comprehensive report on a networked drive, detailing the results of the test case upload process.
  
  4.2. **ASCII Art and User Information**: Ensure the report includes ASCII art, user's name and username, count of successfully uploaded tests, and a section highlighting any failures.
  
  4.3. **Data Inclusion for Analysis**: Include date, RFC information, and other relevant details in the report for further analytical purposes.

### 5. Log Data Generation
  5.1. **Logging System**: Develop a robust logging system to record the operational data and any anomalies encountered during the execution of the API client.

  5.2. **Error Logging and Debugging**: Focus on capturing detailed error logs and debugging information to aid in quick resolution of issues and continuous improvement of the system.
